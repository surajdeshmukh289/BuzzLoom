The external pacemakers are used to manage AFib by providing electrical stimulation to restore the heart’s normal rhythm. AFib is one of the most common arrhythmias globally, particularly among aging populations, thus driving the demand for pacemaker solutions. External pacemakers help in the short-term regulation of heart rhythm until the patient can receive more permanent treatment options, such as catheter ablation or a long-term implantable pacemaker. The rise in AFib cases and the shift toward non-invasive solutions contribute to the market's expansion, especially in the United States where the aging population and lifestyle factors significantly influence the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases.</p><h3>Bradycardia</h3><p>Bradycardia is a condition characterized by a slower than normal heart rate, typically below 60 beats per minute. It often leads to inadequate blood flow to the body, which can result in symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, and fainting. External cardiac pacemakers are frequently used to provide temporary pacing for patients suffering from bradycardia. In emergency situations, external pacemakers are an immediate solution to correct the heart’s rhythm, ensuring that blood circulation is maintained and the heart is functioning optimally. This use is particularly common in critical care units, emergency departments, or during surgeries where bradycardia can occur as a result of anesthesia or other medical interventions.</p><p>The market for external pacemakers catering to bradycardia is expanding, driven by the increasing geriatric population and the rising incidence of lifestyle diseases, including hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for developing bradycardia. Moreover, external pacemakers are often used as a temporary solution before a permanent implantable pacemaker is inserted, further solidifying their demand. Healthcare professionals prefer external pacemakers because they are non-invasive and can be quickly deployed to stabilize a patient's condition while further treatment options are explored. Technological improvements, such as the development of smaller, more efficient pacemaker units, have also contributed to the growing utilization of these devices in managing bradycardia.</p><h3>Atrial Fibrillation</h3><p>Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is one of the most common types of arrhythmia, especially among older adults. It is marked by an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can cause symptoms such as palpitations, fatigue, and chest discomfort. If left untreated, AFib can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular conditions. External pacemakers are used to control the heart rate during an AFib episode by delivering electrical impulses to restore normal rhythm. These pacemakers are often used as a temporary solution in patients experiencing acute AFib while awaiting a more permanent treatment, such as catheter ablation or the implantation of a long-term pacemaker.</p><p>The growing prevalence of AFib in the United States, driven in part by the aging population and increasing rates of hypertension and obesity, has significantly boosted the demand for external pacemakers. The treatment of AFib with external pacemakers offers a non-invasive alternative for controlling the rhythm in the short term, reducing the risk of life-threatening complications. As medical research continues to advance, the application of external pacemakers for AFib management is expected to grow, with healthcare providers continually exploring better ways to treat this condition.
